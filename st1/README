### General information

This script generates the networks_file that pmacct uses so it can integrate
 as numbers into the flows even when there's no active BGP session in the
 system

This system works by converting the output of sh ip bpg (either from quagga
 or from cisco) to the pmacct format.

### Usage

Quagga:
  vtysh -c "sh ip sum" | perl quagga_gen_as_network.pl


### Choosing the output format

By default the output is in the format accepted by 0.14.3 and newer
 which adds nexthop information into the dump
!
!<next-hop>,<origin AS number>,<Network>/<numeric mask>
!
10.0.0.1,65500,192.168.1.0/24
10.0.0.2,65501,192.168.2.0/25
10.0.0.3,65502,192.168.4.0/23

If you still want to use the old format without nexthop, you will have to
 set the variable $disable_nexthop to 1
!
! <origin AS number>,<Network>/<numeric mask> 
!
65500,192.168.1.0/24
65501,192.168.2.0/25
65502,192.168.4.0/23
