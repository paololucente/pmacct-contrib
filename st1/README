This script generates the networks_file that pmacct uses so it can integrate
 as numbers into the flows even when there's no active BGP session in the
 system

This system works by converting the output of sh ip bpg (either from quagga
 or from cisco) to the pmacct format.

Quagga:
  vtysh -c "sh ip sum" | perl quagga_gen_as_network.pl
